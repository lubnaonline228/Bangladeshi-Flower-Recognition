# A Bangladeshi Flower Recognizer
This repository contains files and documents for an application that uses Machine Learning to recognize Bangladeshi flowers. 

## Problem Statement
Bangladesh is home to a diverse a large variety of flowers. As such, a flower recognition application tailored to identify Bangladeshi flowers serves as a valuable tool for both enthusiasts and professionals. For hobbyists, it enhances the experience of nature walks and garden visits, offering instant knowledge about the flowers they encounter. Moreover, for researchers and environmentalists, the app accelerates species identification, facilitating biodiversity surveys and conservation initiatives. Given the rich cultural significance of flowers in Bangladeshi traditions, this app also fosters a deeper connection to the country's natural heritage, promoting appreciation and stewardship of its floral diversity.

The goal of this project is to create and train a model that can recognize 10 different types of Bangladeshi flowers:
1. Beli
2. Gada
3. Joba
4. Kamini
5. Kodom
6. Palash
7. Rose
8. Sheuli
9. Sunflower
10. Water Lily
